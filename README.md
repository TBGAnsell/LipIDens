# Protocol - simulation assisted interpretation of lipid densities

Protocol is a pipeline for simulation assisted interpretation of lipid or lipid-like cryo-EM densties. The protocol can be used to establish CG simulations, analyse lipid binding sites using PyLipID, screen, rank and process PyLipID outputs and establish atomistic siulations to refine lipid binding poses.
